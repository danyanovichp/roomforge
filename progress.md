Original prompt: PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN: migrate the app from R3F overview + Pannellum panoramas to a single R3F 3D house tour with shared housePlan data, procedural room scenes, neighbor-only navigation, info hotspots, and UI-only CTA.

- 2026-03-08: Confirmed current app uses Pannellum panoramas and hardcoded overview geometry. Build passes before refactor.
- 2026-03-08: Planned refactor to shared `housePlan`, procedural room scenes, app state cleanup, and responsive UI updates.
- 2026-03-08: Replaced panorama flow with a shared `housePlan`, data-driven overview, procedural `RoomScene`, HTML hotspots, loading/error overlays, and CTA success state.
- 2026-03-08: Removed runtime dependency on Pannellum and `panoramaUrl`; room interiors are now generated in-browser with R3F primitives.
- 2026-03-08: Verified `npm run build` passes after refactor. Vite still reports the pre-existing `three-mesh-bvh` / `BatchedMesh` warning and a large chunk warning.
- 2026-03-08: Verified overview opens 3D rooms via Playwright client and confirmed `Living Room -> Kitchen` neighbor navigation in a direct Playwright script. Artifacts saved under `output/`.
- 2026-03-08: Switched room scenes to an isometric cutaway view and rebalanced palette/lighting so overview and room shots read clearly without the previous white washout.
- 2026-03-08: Adjusted isometric room entry framing, enabled zoom on OrbitControls, and grounded suspended fixtures/furniture placements for a more coherent composition.
- 2026-03-08: Began migrating the planner from a fixed room-tour model to an editable `floors -> rooms -> doors/windows/objects` house model. Seeded multi-floor data with classic color swatches, room/floor creation helpers, and object definitions in `src/data/housePlan.js`.
- 2026-03-08: Rebuilt the app shell into a left-inspector editor with house/room view switching, persistent selection state, color editing, room resizing, object movement nudges, room creation, and floor creation. Removed the old quote CTA flow.
- 2026-03-08: Replaced the overview with a stacked transparent house view and replaced the room scene with a selectable cutaway editor scene including door navigation, window/door/object picking, and inspector-driven edits.
- 2026-03-08: Fixed room hit-testing so transparent ceiling geometry no longer blocks object selection. Verified with Playwright that clicking a room object selects it (`living-sofa`), door navigation reaches `kitchen`, room edits persist, room count increases from 7 to 8 after add-room, and floor count increases from 2 to 3 after add-floor.
- 2026-03-08: `npm run build` passes after the planner rewrite. Vite still reports the pre-existing `three-mesh-bvh` / `BatchedMesh` warning and large chunk warning.
- 2026-03-08: Additional Playwright verification artifacts saved under `output/planner-house/`, `output/planner-room-view/`, and `output/planner-e2e/`. The scripted E2E run completed without console or page errors.

TODO / handoff:
- Consider adding explicit code-splitting for the large room-scene bundle.
- Add stable test selectors for 3D object pick targets and per-door buttons so future Playwright coverage can avoid coordinate-based clicks entirely.
- Consider adding direct drag for object movement if a richer editing UX is needed beyond inspector nudges.

- 2026-03-08: Enabled 360-degree orbital rotation for the isometric room camera via OrbitControls while keeping the fixed isometric tilt.
- 2026-03-08: Replaced the previous planner shell with a RoomForge demo app: `Apartment / House` project types, template switching, 2D / isometric / 3D modes, A/B variants, live layout validation, and PNG/PDF/JSON export.
- 2026-03-08: Added normalized planner data in `src/data/plannerData.js` and planner state utilities in `src/lib/planner.js`, including templates, style presets, lighting scenarios, categorized catalog data, variant tiers, and export helpers.
- 2026-03-08: Added `src/components/Planner2D.jsx` for grid-based editing and drag/drop placement plus `src/components/PlannerScene.jsx` for shared isometric/3D rendering with selected-item glow and single-wall fade near the camera.
- 2026-03-08: Added repository polish deliverables: `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, GitHub issue templates, `vercel.json`, and a README screenshot asset at `public/docs/roomforge-demo.png`.
- 2026-03-08: Verified `npm run build` passes after the RoomForge rewrite. Vite still reports the pre-existing `three-mesh-bvh` / `BatchedMesh` warning and a large bundle warning. Verified the default 2D demo view via Playwright; fresh artifact state shows `issues: 0` in `output/web-game/state-0.json`.
- 2026-03-08: Removed export capability for now from the app shell and docs, and removed the temporary `jspdf` dependency. Verified `npm run build` still passes after the removal.
- 2026-03-08: Replaced the old scale-only item variants with family-specific procedural variant profiles in `src/data/plannerData.js` and updated `src/components/PlannerScene.jsx` to render distinct silhouettes per tier (for example loveseat / track-arm / tuxedo / armless / curved sofas, single / platform / sleigh / low / canopy beds, and analogous families for chairs, tables, storage, mirrors, lights, bath fixtures, appliances, textiles, and decor).
- 2026-03-08: Added direct in-scene dragging for items in `isometric` and `3d` modes via a floor-plane drag interaction in `src/components/PlannerScene.jsx`; OrbitControls now pause while an item is being dragged so movement behaves more like a game editor than a camera tool.
- 2026-03-08: Collapsed view modes to two user-facing options only: `2D` and `Isometric`. Removed the separate `3D` mode branch from the UI/state/docs, with isometric remaining the only 3D-like presentation mode.
- 2026-03-08: Removed compare controls and compare-facing copy from the UI, docs, and layout styles. The app now presents a single active layout without A/B buttons or side-by-side comparison controls.
- 2026-03-08: Added procedural mini-previews for catalog cards and replacement cards via `src/components/ItemVariantPreview.jsx`, so each replacement now shows a silhouette matching the actual target variant instead of a generic swatch. Also switched the initial view mode from `2D` to `Isometric`.

Updated TODO / handoff:
- Add stable selectors and viewport-aware controls so Playwright can exercise the isometric and 3D modes without relying on coordinate guesses.
- Deepen the hybrid wall editing model beyond rectangular room resizing if manual non-rectilinear wall shaping becomes a hard requirement.
- Replace procedural/local placeholder asset keys with true local GLTF hero assets for more of the catalog if visual fidelity becomes the next priority.

- 2026-03-09: Added global light/dark theme state with system-default detection, manual toggle, and `localStorage` persistence under `roomforge.theme`. The app now updates `documentElement` color-scheme and `body` background/text when theme changes.
- 2026-03-09: Reworked visual tokens in `src/index.css` to use theme-aware CSS variables with higher text contrast, less washout, stronger active states, more visible swatch rings, and darker/clearer floating badges.
- 2026-03-09: Expanded `STYLE_PRESETS` in `src/data/plannerData.js` to carry distinct `light` and `dark` scene palettes, and updated `getSceneConfig(variant, themeMode)` so 2D/3D scenes follow the selected theme while keeping preset identity.
- 2026-03-09: Updated 3D item highlight and scene material accents to pull from the active palette instead of fixed light-only colors.
- 2026-03-09: Verified `npm run build` passes after the theme overhaul. Vite still reports the pre-existing `three-mesh-bvh` / `BatchedMesh` warning and large bundle warning.
- 2026-03-09: Ran the required Playwright web-game client against `http://127.0.0.1:5173` and captured fresh state artifacts under `output/theme-light/`. The text-state smoke test passed. A subsequent full-page Playwright run hit a local Chromium WebGL-context limitation in this environment, so end-to-end visual page screenshots for the R3F scene could not be fully validated headlessly.

Updated TODO / handoff:
- Add stable theme-toggle test selectors so Playwright can switch themes without coordinate guessing.
- If automated full-page screenshots are needed in CI, add a fallback scene/error boundary or a software-rendering strategy for environments where Chromium cannot create a WebGL context.

- 2026-03-09: Added one-command local bootstrap via `npm start`. New `scripts/start.mjs` now checks for required dependencies, runs `npm install` when needed, starts Vite, waits for the real local URL, and auto-opens the browser unless `ROOMFORGE_NO_OPEN=1` is set.
- 2026-03-09: Added `npm run setup` as an explicit install helper and updated `README.md` so `npm start` is the primary local run path while `npm run dev` remains the lower-level developer flow.
- 2026-03-09: Verified `npm start` works with existing dependencies, prints the reachable URL, and leaves no lingering Vite/bootstrap processes after `Ctrl+C`.
- 2026-03-09: Verified the occupied-port case by keeping `5173` busy and starting the bootstrap script in parallel. The script correctly waited for Vite's announced fallback URL and reported `http://127.0.0.1:5174/` instead of attaching to the already-running server.

- 2026-03-11: Refocused the UI on apartment planning in `src/App.jsx`: hid project-type / styles / lighting / furniture-library / related-replacements controls without deleting underlying data, switched the main controls to compact selects, and added a wall-expansion modal for creating adjacent rooms from selected walls.
- 2026-03-11: Updated planner behavior in `src/lib/planner.js`, `src/components/Planner2D.jsx`, and `src/components/PlannerScene.jsx` so item movement now requires prior selection, clicking empty space clears selection, item movement snaps to a 1 meter grid in both 2D and isometric views, selected walls show a visible `+`, and confirming the wall modal creates a new room plus paired door openings.
- 2026-03-11: Strengthened the visible 2D grid/walls and area formatting. `src/data/plannerData.js` now truncates area display to two decimals (for example `21.59`) and both 2D and isometric room badges use the shared formatter.
- 2026-03-11: Verified `npm run build` passes after the apartment UX refactor. Vite still reports the pre-existing `three-mesh-bvh` / `BatchedMesh` warning and large bundle warning.
- 2026-03-11: Ran the required Playwright web-game client against `http://127.0.0.1:4173` and captured a fresh visual artifact at `output/apartment-ux/shot-0.png`. The 2D apartment shell/grid rendered correctly in the screenshot; the text-state artifact remained in `2d`, so automated coverage for the select-driven switch to isometric still needs stable selectors.

Updated TODO / handoff:
- Add stable test selectors for workspace selects and wall-plus controls so Playwright can verify 2D-to-isometric transitions and wall-room creation without relying on fragile coordinate clicks.
- Consider rendering visible door markers/openings in isometric as actual cutouts if wall-editing fidelity becomes the next priority.

- 2026-03-25: Reworked `src/App.jsx` into a fuller planner cockpit with visible room/floor navigation, presentation controls for theme/style/lighting, stronger scene hints, a more actionable selection inspector, and validation cards that jump directly to affected rooms/items.
- 2026-03-25: Added a searchable room-aware furniture library in `src/components/PlannerLibrary.jsx`, restored discoverability for catalog content, and wired one-click placement to suggested in-room positions instead of forcing manual drag/drop for every addition.
- 2026-03-25: Strengthened planner helpers in `src/lib/planner.js`: added suggested item placement, richer validation metadata, room-overlap validation, safer runtime ids, and auto-selection of newly added items.
- 2026-03-25: Added stable test selectors and clearer affordances in `src/components/Planner2D.jsx` and `src/components/PlannerScene.jsx`, plus refreshed `src/index.css` to support the new navigator/library/validation UI with stronger visual hierarchy.
- 2026-03-25: Updated `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to reflect the current planner workflow, room-aware library, and improved validation/navigation surface.
- 2026-03-25: Verified `npm run build` passes after the UX/code/docs batch. `npm run verify:package` only passed the initial packaging step when rerun with a writable temp npm cache; the full clean-install smoke flow remains environment-limited here because npm packaging/logging defaults and networked install behavior are sandbox-constrained.

- 2026-04-01: Added explicit wall-level opening authoring in `src/App.jsx` and `src/lib/planner.js`. Selected walls can now open a dedicated door/window composer with width and center-offset controls, and new openings are clamped to the wall span automatically.
- 2026-04-01: Updated `src/components/Planner2D.jsx`, `src/components/PlannerScene.jsx`, and `src/index.css` so authored doors/windows render immediately in 2D and remain visible as lightweight markers in isometric mode. Added stable test selectors for rendered 2D openings and wall-action buttons.
- 2026-04-01: Updated `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md` to move door/window authoring into the shipped baseline and narrow the next follow-up to editing/deleting existing openings plus stronger clearance logic.
- 2026-04-01: Verified both `npm run build` and `npm run verify:package` pass after the opening-authoring slice. Vite still reports the pre-existing `three-mesh-bvh` / `BatchedMesh` warning and large bundle warning.

Updated TODO / handoff:
- Add edit/delete controls for existing doors and windows; this slice only supports explicit creation.
- Upgrade isometric opening markers from lightweight overlays to true wall cutouts if presentation fidelity becomes a priority.
- Keep pushing on code-splitting for the ~1 MB app bundle before the planner surface grows much further.
